### Custom Blocks ###

Within your resources folder, there should be a folder structure of:

resources
    -assets
        -mod_id_name_here
            -blockstates

            -lang
                en_us.json (or any language identifier like de_de.json)
            -models
                -block
                    name_of_block.json
                -item
                    name_of_item.json
            textures
                -block
                    texture.png
                -item
                    texture.png

The structure of a basic block's blockstates json file:

{
    "variants":
        "": {
          "model": "modid:block/name_of_block_here"
    }
}

The structure of a json file within the models/block folder:

{
    "parent": "block/cube_all"
    "textures" {
        "layer0": "modid:block/name_of_block_here"
    }
}

The structure of a json file within the models/item folder:
{
    "parent": "item/generated"
    "textures" {
        "layer0": "modid:item/name_of_item_here"
    }
}

Blockstates:
    A blockstate determines the different appearances and states a block can have. As well as specify how those states
    map to different models and textures.

Parent:
    Parent is particularly used for models. The "parent" key is used to specify a base model that the current model
    should inherit from. This allows for modularity by enabling one model to build upon or modify another.

    So in the case of a normal block, the parent we often use is "block/cube_all". This is because minecraft provides
    several common parent models for us to use and cube_all is set up where all faces of our model have the same texture.

Textures:
    Textures is pretty self-explanatory -- we're just defining the texture that we want to use which is usually in the
    textures/block or textures/item folders.

    For blocks we typically want them to remain as 3d cubes in our inventory.
    For items we typically want them to remain as 2d sprites.
