This GitHub Repository is a result of following along with Kaupenjoe's Minecraft Modding Course using Fabric for version 1.20.X 
found here: <a href="https://courses.kaupenjoe.net/p/modding-by-kaupenjoe-fabric-modding-for-minecraft-1-20-x" target="_blank">COURSE</a>

# Introduction
As a pure beginner to Java and modding with the Fabric API. I decided to pick up the aforementioned course and I am struggling to fully internalize and 
develop deeper understandings of the concepts within this course.

The idea relates heavily to the concept of "Tutorial Hell".

## Goals with this repository:

I have a few goals with this repository and I hope to see a majority of them through as this not only serves as my own
personal learning archive but hopefully as a great learning tool for other beginners like myself. These goals include
such things as:

- Version Control - Learning the ins and outs of using/utilizing GitHub(Git) for future projects,
potential collaboration and contributions to open-source projects in the future.


- Documenting Progress - To solidify my understanding of both Java and the Fabric API through code documentation 
utilizing clear, concise javadoc comments written from my own understanding.


- Public repository contribution - Contributing to the overall knowledge base surrounding Minecraft Modding and
the Fabric API.


- Continued Learning and Development - as I both progress and complete the course, I will likely take what I have 
learned and continue to build upon this repository adding additional content under a "development" branch as a means of 
both giving back and putting things into practice.


- Maintaining Motivation - Establishing clear goals in mind with this little project keeps me interested in programming,
  regardless of how difficult or frustrating it may get.


- Personal Growth - This project hopefully becomes something I can show and be proud of.
